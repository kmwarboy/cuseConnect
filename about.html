          <h2>why?</h2>
          <p>
            Syracuse has started to become a more modern city recent years. As
            one of the largest metropolitan areas in the state, I felt there was
            a need for smarter access to information for city residents. There
            is a growing tech community, and a demand for a more modern
            lifestyle.
